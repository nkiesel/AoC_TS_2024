## Notes

It was pretty simple to convert my Kotlin solution to TypeScript. The only real issue I had when writing the Kotlin code
was that I first thought I had to re-start the processing with every input line. This produced the wrong result for
part 2 because it always treated the first mul instruction in every line as enabled.
