## Notes

Slowly re-creating my Kotlin CharArea in TypeScript...

Otherwise, basically nothing done here but re-coding my Kotlin solution in TypeScript.

The one issue I ran into was that for part 2, I forgot to add the visited point + direction
to the visited set because the Kotlin `Set::add` returns `true` if added and `false` if not added,
while the TS Set add operation returns the updated set. Thus, I had to use `visited.has` and
then forgot to call `visted.add`, resulting in non-terminating loop.
